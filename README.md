# JSGraphics

Some graphics projects I had to do. <br>
Looking back, Praise the Emperor is very poorly done. Multiple "times" and animation depending on them is very stupid and you should never do it. Let it stay open for 5+ mins in some background tab and check it again ;) <br>


P.S. Human.js was used ready-made.
